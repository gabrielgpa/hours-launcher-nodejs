# hours-launcher-nodejs
> This project was created to implement the designer patterns Factory and Observer. The context used is the generation of random periods based on a data entry that must correspond to the total hours worked in the day. The script will receive the informed period as input and will return a list with several start and end times, where the interval corresponds to the value informed in the input.

### Requirements:
- NodeJs 13 (experimental)

### Run project
```
npm i
npm start
```
